# Prompts das imagens das lições

18 imagens para `img/licoes/`. Elas aparecem na tela de "Parabéns" ao fim de cada nível: a criança vê a pergunta e esta imagem, e o texto da lição fica no botão "Para o professor". Por isso **a imagem precisa contar a ideia da lição sozinha, sem palavras**.

## Antes de começar

- **Gere um chamado por vez, na mesma conversa**, anexando as referências indicadas em cada seção (estão no repositório).
- **Formato 4:3 (paisagem)**, 1600 × 1200. A imagem aparece inteira, sem cortes, num quadro de fundo creme.
- **Diferente das cartas:** aqui pode haver uma cena pequena, personagens e comparações. Muitas lições usam **dois quadros lado a lado**: à esquerda o jeito errado (X vermelho), à direita o certo (check verde).
- **Nada de texto** na imagem. Setas, linhas pontilhadas, X e check podem.
- **Mesmos personagens e objetos do jogo:** o cliente do chamado, o Robô-guia e os objetos das cartas.
- Ao salvar, use o nome indicado em cada bloco (ex.: `sanduiche-1.webp`). A imagem aparece sozinha no jogo, sem mexer no código; o recorte e o ajuste de tamanho são feitos como nas cartas.

**Chamados novos:** as 14 lições de Lavar as mãos, Atravessar a rua, Fazer uma limonada e Escovar os dentes ainda não foram geradas. Os prompts estão no fim deste arquivo.

**Se a imagem sair errada**, peça a correção na mesma conversa: "remove all text", "simpler, fewer objects", "same bee as the reference", "make the left and right panels clearer".

```
Scene: The boy from the reference making a sandwich at a table, and behind him, peeking out like small shy hidden friends, the small easy-to-forget steps drawn as objects: a bread bag being opened with its twist tie off and a butter tub with its lid lifted, highlighted with a soft glow, as if found by a magnifying glass held by the small round white Robô-guia robot with a black face screen and green eyes (from the reference).

Scene: Two side-by-side panels separated by a thin vertical gap. NO red X and NO green check mark anywhere.

A small soft thought bubble above him shows a tiny lightbulb (no text).
Right panel: a simple boxy computer-like robot with a screen face (different from the Robô-guia), standing still in front of a CLOSED bread bag and a CLOSED butter tub, arms down, a big question mark above its head, waiting. In front of it, an empty instruction card with only three small blank lines (no text), showing it needs clear instructions to do anything.

Left panel: the curly-haired boy from the reference drying his clean hands on a light blue towel while, behind him, the tap is still open and water keeps running down the drain, with several water drops and a small worried look on his face. Right panel: the same boy drying his clean hands on the same towel, the tap behind him already closed, no water running, one small green leaf and a single saved water drop with a sparkle above the sink, and a small green check mark in the top corner of this panel only.

## Atravessar a rua

**Anexe como referência:** a imagem de fundo da fase (`img/level6.webp`), `img/guide.webp` (Robô-guia) e as cartas `img/passos/rua-01.webp` a `rua-06.webp`, quando existirem.

**Cenário:** as lições acontecem na mesma rua do fundo da fase (calçada, faixa, cidade ao fundo), com o mesmo menino.

**Cuidado com o tom:** nada de acidente, susto forte ou carro encostando na criança. O perigo aparece só como um carro vindo ao longe e o menino ainda na calçada.

### `rua-1.webp` — Nível 1: Por que olhar antes?

Scene: Two side-by-side panels separated by a thin vertical gap: left panel with a small red X in its top corner, right panel with a small green check mark in its top corner. Left: the boy from the level background (brown skin, curly dark brown hair, yellow hoodie, blue backpack, navy shorts, blue sneakers) on the sidewalk about to step onto the zebra crossing while looking straight ahead, not to the sides, and a small car far away down the street that he has not noticed, with a small exclamation mark above the car. He is still safely on the sidewalk. Right: the same boy standing on the sidewalk at the zebra crossing with his head turned and a hand above his eyes, two small curved arrows pointing left and right, the street empty and calm, the small round white Robô-guia robot with a black face screen, green eyes and a green antenna, floating next to him smiling.

Scene: The boy from the level background (brown skin, curly dark brown hair, yellow hoodie, blue backpack, navy shorts, blue sneakers) stands on the sidewalk next to the pedestrian traffic light from the level background (dark grey box on a grey pole with three round lamps: red on top, amber in the middle, and a green walking figure at the bottom), looking up at it, with a big question mark above his head. From him the scene splits into two small paths, like a fork: the upper path leads to a small picture of the same boy waiting still on the sidewalk under a lamp lit red with a standing figure; the lower path leads to a small picture of the same boy walking on the zebra crossing under a lamp lit green with a walking figure. The small round white robô-guia robot with a black face screen, green eyes and a green antenna, floating beside the fork, pointing at the two paths.

Scene: Three round bubbles in a row across the sky at the top, each with one small picture and a small green check mark beside it: the boy's hand holding an adult's hand; the pedestrian traffic light from the level background (dark grey box on a grey pole with three round lamps: red on top, amber in the middle, and a green walking figure at the bottom) with only the green walking figure lit; the boy's face turned sideways with a hand above his eyes. Three arrows go down from the bubbles and meet at one point below, where the boy from the level background (brown skin, curly dark brown hair, yellow hoodie, blue backpack, navy shorts, blue sneakers) walks on the zebra crossing holding the hand of a friendly adult (seen from behind, no detailed face), both calm and smiling, the small round white Robô-guia robot with a black face screen, green eyes and a green antenna, floating following them.

**Personagem:** sempre o MESMO menino do `level6.webp` (pele morena, cabelo cacheado castanho-escuro, moletom amarelo, bermuda azul-marinho, tênis azul), sem a mochila, porque está em casa. Use só o menino do fundo; a rua e o semáforo não entram.

### `limonada-1.webp` — Nível 1: O que muda no limão a cada passo?

Scene: One row of four stages of the same green lime, from left to right, joined by three arrows: a whole lime with small brown dirt smudges; the same whole lime clean and shiny with water drops; the lime cut in two open halves; a squeezed, flattened lime half next to a small dish of pale yellow-green juice. The boy from the attached level background (brown skin, curly dark brown hair, yellow hoodie, navy shorts, blue sneakers, no backpack) stands at the end of the row, happily pointing at the juice.

### `limonada-2.webp` — Nível 2: Dá para fazer duas coisas ao mesmo tempo?

```
Scene: One kitchen counter seen from the front with two children working side by side at the same time. On the left, the boy from the attached level background (brown skin, curly dark brown hair, yellow hoodie, navy shorts, blue sneakers, no backpack) squeezes half a green lime on a glass juicer. On the right, a second child (a girl with a ponytail and an apron) pours light blue water with ice cubes into a clear glass jug. A small identical clock icon with no numbers floats above each child, showing both things happen at the same moment. In the middle, between them, a long wooden spoon lies on the counter waiting, with a small dotted line from each child to the spoon.

Scene: Two trails of round stepping stones that start far apart on the left and join into one trail on the right, like two rivers meeting. The upper trail has three stones with small icons in order: a green lime under water, a lime cut in halves, a lime half on a juicer. The lower trail has two stones: a glass jug with water and ice, a spoon of sugar over the jug. At the point where the two trails meet, one bigger stone shows the jug being stirred with a wooden spoon. After it, one last stone shows a glass of lemonade. The boy from the attached level background (brown skin, curly dark brown hair, yellow hoodie, navy shorts, blue sneakers, no backpack) and the small round white Robô-guia robot with a black face screen and green eyes (from the reference) stand at the end, the boy holding the glass.

Scene: In the center, big and bright, the girl from the attached portrait (about 8 years old, light skin with a few freckles, wavy reddish-brown hair in two low pigtails tied with light blue hair ties, light blue pajamas with small yellow stars, white slippers) brushing her teeth with white foam, smiling, with a soft glow or a few sparkles around her: this is the main step. To the left, smaller and a bit faded, two little pictures in a row: a hand taking the white toothbrush with a light blue handle out of the pale yellow cup, and toothpaste going onto the brush. Two arrows go from the small pictures into the big central one, like helpers bringing something to it. The small round white Robô-guia robot with a black face screen, green eyes and a green antenna (from the reference), floating at the right, points at the central picture.

Scene: The girl from the attached portrait (about 8 years old, light skin with a few freckles, wavy reddish-brown hair in two low pigtails tied with light blue hair ties, light blue pajamas with small yellow stars, white slippers) stands at a white bathroom sink smiling with clean shiny teeth and a sparkle near her smile. But on the sink counter in front of her: the white toothpaste tube lying with its light blue cap off beside it and a little toothpaste squeezed out, and the white toothbrush with a light blue handle lying on the counter, dirty with foam, outside the empty pale yellow cup. Three small soft circles highlight the open tube, the dirty brush and the empty cup. The small round white Robô-guia robot with a black face screen, green eyes and a green antenna (from the reference) floats beside the sink looking at the mess with a curious tilted head.

Left panel has a small moon-and-stars bedtime clock icon with no numbers (the start), right panel the same icon (the end), showing nothing changed. Between the panels, in the middle, the girl from the attached portrait (about 8 years old, light skin with a few freckles, wavy reddish-brown hair in two low pigtails tied with light blue hair ties, light blue pajamas with small yellow stars, white slippers) smiles with clean teeth, and two curved arcs go over her head from left to right: one arc from the tube to the tube (opened, then closed) and one from the cup to the cup (taken, then put back). The small round white Robô-guia robot with a black face screen, green eyes and a green antenna (from the reference) gives a happy wave.
