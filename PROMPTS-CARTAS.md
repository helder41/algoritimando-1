# Prompts das ilustrações das cartas

37 imagens para `img/passos/` (a do presunto, `sanduiche-03.webp`, já existe e é a referência de estilo). Cada prompt abaixo já traz o estilo, o tamanho e as regras: é só copiar o bloco inteiro.

## Antes de começar

**Como gerar**
1. Gere **um chamado por vez, na mesma conversa** do gerador de imagens. Em toda geração, anexe as imagens de referência indicadas no começo de cada seção (estão no repositório).
2. Quando a **primeira carta** de um chamado ficar boa, anexe-a também nas seguintes: assim o pão, o robô, a mochila e a abelha saem iguais em todas as cartas.
3. Escolha o formato **4:3** no gerador (paisagem). Se ele só tiver quadrado, use quadrado: o jogo encaixa sem cortar.

**Regras que valem para todas** (já estão nos prompts)
- **Uma ação por carta, sem entregar a ordem.** A carta mostra só o próprio passo. Nada de números, de "1º/2º", nem do resultado dos passos seguintes. É a criança quem descobre a ordem.
- **Nada de texto** na imagem: nem palavras, nem letras, nem números. A legenda já vem embaixo da carta.
- **Legível em tamanho pequeno**: no jogo a ilustração aparece com uns 100 px. Silhueta forte, poucos detalhes, um assunto só, centralizado e com margem.
- **Fundo branco liso**, sem cenário. Setas simples e linhas de movimento podem (ajudam a mostrar a ação).
- **Mesmo estilo do jogo**: contorno marrom-escuro grosso, cores pastel, sombra cinza suave embaixo.

**Depois de gerar**
- Me mande as imagens aqui no chat (pode ser em lote, com o nome do arquivo de cada uma). Eu tiro o fundo branco, deixo transparente, ajusto para **600 × 450 px**, salvo com o nome certo em `img/passos/` e subo para o GitHub.
- Se preferir fazer sozinho: PNG com fundo transparente, 600 × 450 px, com o nome exato da tabela. A carta troca sozinha, sem mexer no código.

**Chamados novos:** as 20 cartas de Lavar as mãos, Atravessar a rua e Fazer uma limonada ainda não foram geradas. Os prompts estão no fim deste arquivo.

**Se a imagem sair errada**, peça a correção na mesma conversa: "remove the text", "no background, plain white", "make it simpler and bolder", "same robot as the reference", "no lettuce".

## Fazer um sanduíche (Cozinha)

**Pronto:** as 13 cartas já estão no jogo.

**Anexe como referência:** `img/pic1.webp` (o sanduíche da central: pão, presunto e queijo, sem alface) e `img/passos/sanduiche-03.webp` (o presunto, já pronto).

**Consistência:** Mesmo pão, mesmo queijo e mesma manteiga em todas: pão de forma branco com casca dourada, queijo amarelo quadrado, manteiga amarelo-clara. Sem alface nem tomate (o jogo não tem esses passos).

**Consistência:** Sempre os MESMOS limões (limão-taiti, verde, casca lisa), a mesma jarra de vidro transparente com alça, a mesma colher de pau comprida, o mesmo espremedor manual de vidro e o mesmo copo liso. Quando aparece uma criança, é sempre o MESMO menino do `level6.webp` (pele morena, cabelo cacheado castanho-escuro, moletom amarelo, bermuda azul-marinho), sem a mochila, porque está em casa. Nas cartas aparecem só as mãos dele (com a manga amarela do moletom), sem rosto. Objetos sem rosto. Uma coisa por carta: a carta do limão não mostra a jarra, e a carta da jarra não mostra o limão.

### `limonada-01.webp` — Lave os limões.

```
Subject: Three whole green limes in a small white colander under a stream of light blue water from a silver tap, water drops splashing off them, held and rubbed by the two small brown-skinned hands of the boy from the attached level background, with the yellow hoodie sleeves visible (only hands and forearms, no face). The limes are whole, not cut. No jar, no knife. Objects have no faces.
Attached images: level background (the boy, for his hands and sleeve) and card style reference. Only hands and forearms of the boy, never his face or body; no kitchen scenery.
Style: cute flat cartoon sticker illustration for a children's educational game (ages 8 to 10), matching the attached style reference exactly: thick dark brown outlines (#3B2A2A), soft warm pastel colors, simple flat shading with one small white highlight, rounded friendly shapes, a small soft grey oval shadow under the subject. Composition: one single subject, centered, filling about 70% of the frame, with clear empty margin on all sides so nothing touches the edges. Background: plain pure white (#FFFFFF), no scenery, no floor, no frame, no border, no card shape. Never include: text, letters, numbers, logos, watermarks, photorealism, 3D render, heavy gradients. Must stay readable when shown very small (about 100 px wide): bold simple silhouette, few details. Aspect ratio 4:3, 1200x900 px.
